# Top-Leader-Random-Walk-with-Teleportation

## Overview

This project implements a random walk algorithm in Python using NetworkX to analyze connectivity patterns in directed graphs constructed from CSV data. The algorithm calculates visit frequencies of nodes during the random walk, aiming to identify influential nodes or top leaders within the graph structure.

## Features

- **Random Walk Implementation**: Utilizes NetworkX for graph construction and random walk simulation.
- **Node Ranking**: Computes visit frequencies to determine influential nodes based on traversal patterns.
- **Data Handling**: Parses data from a CSV file to build a directed graph representing node interactions or relationships.
